# Kwik
Kwik is a wiki engine written in Ruby, MediaWiki compatible, but without the bloated features.

It's intended to be used as a personal or small organization wiki, where users are trusted and time is not meant to be spent on maintenance.

It uses the filesystem as storage, so there's no need to set up a database backend.
